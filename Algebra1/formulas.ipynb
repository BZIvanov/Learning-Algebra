    "#### What is the difference between Slope formula and Slope - Intercept formula?\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between the two slope formulas is that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **y = mx + b** gives you the equation of a line in _slope-intercept form_, where the slope (m) and y-intercept (b) are readily available.\n",
    "- **m = (Y2 - Y1) / (X2 - X1)** is a formula specifically for calculating the _slope (m)_ of a line given two points on that line. Those points are represented by their coordinates (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the connection:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The slope (m) in **y = mx + b** is the same concept as the slope (m) calculated from the point formula **m = (Y2 - Y1) / (X2 - X1)**.\n",
    "- They both represent the rise over run of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you are given the equation of the line (like y = mx + b), you can directly read the slope (m) from the equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if you are only given two points on the line, you can use the second formula  m = (Y2 - Y1) / (X2 - X1)  to find the slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the second formula is a step you might use to get the information (slope) that you can then plug into the first equation (slope-intercept form) to fully represent the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Point - Slope form\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula to also calculate the slope (m)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ m = \\frac{Y - Y_{1}}{X - X_{1}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Y - Y_{1} = m(X - X_{1}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the difference between Slope formula and Point - Slope formula?\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between **m = (Y - Y1) / (X - X1)** and **m = (Y2 - Y1) / (X2 - X1)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the Slope formula, (Y2 - Y1) / (X2 - X1), you were given two specific points, (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2), on the line.\n",
    "- In the Point - Slope formula, (Y - Y1) / (X - X1), we have a point (X1, Y1) on the line, but (X, Y) represents any **general point** on the same line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **(X1, Y1)** is a specific **fixed** point on the line (like a reference point).\n",
    "- **(X, Y)** represents any **variable** point on the line. As you change the values of (X, Y), it will represent different points along the same line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula **m = (Y - Y1) / (X - X1)** essentially calculates the slope  **relative to the fixed point  (X1, Y1)**.  Since the slope is constant for any line, this formula will give you the same answer (slope) no matter which point **(X, Y)** you choose on the line, as long as it's on the same line as **(X1, Y1)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, both formulas calculate the slope, but:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first one uses **two specific points** to define the line.\n",
    "- The second one uses **one specific point** as a reference and **any other point** on the same line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard form\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the same as linear equation in two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation represents a general linear relationship between two variables, x and y. It doesn't directly tell you the slope, but it contains the information needed to find it. The coefficients a and b relate to the slope and y-intercept of the line.\n",

    "## Distance\n",
